# survey-taker
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This project reflects my knowledge of binary search trees after taking CS 142 at Edmonds College. The project represents a survey that tries to find the favorite subject of the user. There are currently surveys such as cereal and ivy leagues. </p>
<h3>How to use</h3>
<p>Run SurveyTreeClient.java in the src directory. To add a new quiz, create a new txt file in the project directory. The first result is the leftmost path.</p>
